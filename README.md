# bank_account_case

</br>

<b> init </b></br>
Here i am starting my object these args only need to be filled out if you are going to move money:</br> 
these include withdraw and deposit into ANY account 
</br></br></br>

<b> withdraw/ deposit </b> </br>
I know that there is a way to put all of these open files/ write files into a function maybe but i am not able to do it </br>
in these methods you dont need anything besides what was initialized in the init method 
</br>
</br> </br>

<b> new_emp/ new_client </b> </br>
Here you will need to add all the new information need to create a client and employee.  There is no way to could the IDs and make sure its a primary key in JSON so this will also need to be done manually.
